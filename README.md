# 🛡️ Knight vs Goo – 2D Platformer Game

This is my first-ever 2D platformer game built using the Godot Engine!  
I followed tutorials by [HeartBeast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0&t=4350s) and [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys) to understand the basics of game design, animation, and gameplay logic.

## 🎮 Gameplay Features
- Player movement with jump, gravity, and animation
- Enemy slime AI with patrol and attack behavior
- One-way platforms and platform collisions
- Camera that follows the player across the level
- Background music integration

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Godot Engine v4**
- **GDScript** for scripting logic
- **Piskel** for pixel art editing
- **Tiled** (optional) for level design

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `assets/`: Sprites and tiles
- `scenes/`: Game scenes (levels, player, enemy)
- `scripts/`: GDScript files
- `export/`: Exported builds (optional)
